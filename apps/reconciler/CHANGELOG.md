## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- cde0691: **The inbox moved inside the vault, and human edits became first-class.**
  Captures live at `Knowledge/Inbox/` — Obsidian's vault root is `Knowledge/`,
  so that is the only place it can see them, add to them and edit them — and
  they are tracked, so git carries them: the inbox used to be the one thing a
  `docker compose down -v` rebuild could not bring back (invariant 1).
  `docs/ops/inbox.md`.
  
  - **One sink, every door.** `POST /capture`, the `/note` fast path, the
    bridge's `capture` tool and the collectors all write through the
    reconciler's vault bridge with `expected_sha256: ""` — must not exist — so
    a capture can never land on a file someone already wrote. The console still
    holds no part of the instance repo (D5, invariant 7), and each capture is a
    commit. With no bridge configured it degrades to a plain directory: capture
    keeps working, and moving those files into `Knowledge/Inbox/` later is
    enough for the scan below to pick them up.
  - **Files you write yourself are indexed.** The reconcile loop already walks
    the vault by content hash, so it now also reconciles `Knowledge/Inbox/`: a
    note you added in Obsidian gets a triage row, an edit to a capture
    refreshes its hash and — if it had already been classified or accepted —
    sends it back to `inbox-drain`, because a refinement is new information. A
    `rejected` row stays rejected; a deleted file archives its row rather than
    losing it; the file coming back re-opens it. No new watcher, no new
    component talking to Postgres (invariant 3).
  - **`knowledge_write` can no longer overwrite a note it has not seen.**
    Omitting `expected_sha256` used to mean "unconditional", which meant an
    edit *you* made to a page the assistant owns could vanish with no conflict
    and no trace but the commit. It now means create-only: an existing note
    answers `conflict` with the current hash, so changing a note requires
    `knowledge_read` first. Misuse test ships with it.
  - **Big captures.** Above `METISTRY_INBOX_MAX_TRACKED_BYTES` (5 MiB) a
    capture goes to `Knowledge/Inbox/.large/`, which the instance gitignores:
    Obsidian still sees a 40 MB screen recording, the repo does not carry it.
  - **`metistry migrate-inbox`** moves an existing instance — files (`git mv`
    for what git tracks), `.gitignore`, and `inbox.path` rows to the
    repo-relative form `db/migrations/0001_init.sql` always documented — with
    `--dry-run`, idempotent, restarting nothing. A second instance that already
    moved its inbox to a lowercase `Knowledge/inbox/` is renamed through a temp
    name, because macOS is case-insensitive and `git mv` would otherwise move
    the directory inside itself.
  
  Migration `0015_inbox_in_vault.sql` is additive: a partial unique index makes
  "one row per inbox file" true at the database, since the capture path and the
  scan both reach that directory now.

### Patch Changes

- 75c7547: **Local models: discovery, install, and a `llama-server` in the box.** Three
  local model servers, one protocol. LM Studio and Ollama are **peers** —
  discovered over `GET /v1/models` wherever they already run, never started by
  Metistry — and llama.cpp's `llama-server` is now **bundled**: built from
  pinned source into the runtime pack with Metal on, signed alongside Postgres
  and git, so a Mac with neither peer installed still has a local model
  provider and nothing to download first.
  
  `metistry compute models list` is live `/v1/models` against every declared
  provider **plus** a scan of the three known local ports, so a server that is
  running but that nothing dials is reported with the one command that would
  wire it up rather than silently omitted. `metistry doctor` carries the same
  finding as `local:lmstudio`, `local:ollama` and `local:llamaserver` rows —
  each `ok` with what it has loaded, or `absent`. **Absent is never a
  failure:** a Mac with no local server is a supported install and these rows
  can only add information.
  
  `metistry compute models install <provider>/<model>` speaks each server's own
  mechanism: `lms get` for LM Studio, streamed `POST /api/pull` for Ollama,
  and for `llama-server` one plain HTTPS GET of a Hugging Face GGUF into
  `<instance>/state/models/`, checked against the sha256 Hugging Face publishes
  before anything is written and then recorded as `serve.model_path`. `load`
  and `unload` act for LM Studio and are an honest message for the other two,
  which have no addressable load. No new dependency: a GGUF is one file behind
  one URL.
  
  `compute.yaml` gains an **additive, optional** `serve: { runtime, model_path,
  port, extra_args }` block. A provider without it is exactly what shipped
  before. A provider with it is one Metistry runs itself, as an optional
  supervisor child called `llamaserver` — `metistry logs llamaserver`,
  `metistry restart llamaserver`, a `child:llamaserver` doctor row. The host is
  hard-coded to loopback, the port must be the one `base_url` already dials,
  and a missing binary or GGUF is a note rather than a failed `up`.
  
  **Embeddings move to `/v1/embeddings`.** Knowledge search used Ollama's
  native `/api/embed`, which made Ollama the only server that could ever embed;
  it now posts the OpenAI-compatible route at `METISTRY_LOCAL_MODEL_URL`,
  defaulting to the first `on_machine` provider's `base_url` in `compute.yaml`.
  `METISTRY_OLLAMA_URL` keeps working as a deprecated alias — a bare host is
  mapped onto its `/v1` root — with one startup warning naming the new
  variable. `METISTRY_EMBED_MODEL` and `METISTRY_EMBED_DIM` are unchanged, so
  no re-embed is required.
  
  Docs: `docs/ops/compute.md` gains "Local models"; `docs/ops/bundled-runtime.md`,
  `docs/ops/cli.md`, `docs/ops/knowledge-search.md` updated.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4774e08: Phase 6 — embeddings on reconcile, and semantic search behind the same
  grants.
  
  The reconciler embeds settled notes as it reconciles (local Ollama
  `nomic-embed-text`, model and dim per row) and gains
  `POST /embeddings/rebuild`. `GET /vault/search` and mcp-brain's
  `knowledge_search` take `mode=keyword|semantic|hybrid`, defaulting to
  hybrid once vectors exist and keyword before that. Every mode keeps the
  grant tier and the draft exclusion in SQL. With no embedder running,
  search still answers in keyword and the index is unaffected.
  
  Migration 0012 adds `knowledge_files.embedded_hash` / `embedded_model`
  (additive, derived).

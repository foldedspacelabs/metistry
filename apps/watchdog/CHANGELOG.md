## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- d21f953: **The product no longer ships a claude.ai-login path or the Claude Agent SDK;
  compute is configured in `compute.yaml`.** One engine remains — the
  OpenAI-compatible loop — and Claude is reached through OpenRouter like any
  other cloud model (owner's decision, `docs/plan-refresh-2026-09-13.md` C2/C3).
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` leaves every `package.json` and the lockfile;
  `engine-sdk.ts`, the `anthropic` engine kind and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` are
  gone from the engine, the CLI's env allowlist and secret table, the plists,
  `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example` and the docs. Version bumps are `minor`
  across the fixed set rather than `major` because fixed mode moves every package
  together and a major here would say something about packages this does not
  touch; the behaviour change is stated here, in `docs/ops/compute.md` and in
  `docs/ops/assistant-tools.md` ("Running without an engine").
  
  **"Is there an engine" is now one seam over two facts.** `engineStatus(compute,
  env)` in `packages/core/src/compute.ts` replaces `engineCredentialPresent(env)`:
  an engine is an `assignments.default` *and* the key its provider names in
  `providers.<name>.auth.secret`. `metistry up` (whether the assistant is a
  supervisor child), `metistry doctor` (the `assistant` row), the routine
  runner's preflight (`requires.engine`) and — through the supervisor's child
  list — the watchdog all read it, so they cannot disagree; each refusal names
  the missing half and the verb that fixes it. `makeEngine` throws a named
  `NoEngineError` for a turn nothing assigns rather than inventing one, and the
  drain never starts: an install with no assignment behaves exactly as #145 made
  it, with captures, tasks, search and the console running and queued turns
  waiting. **Both deployment shapes now run engine-less** — `docker-compose.yml`
  no longer interpolates a credential as required.
  
  **The engine's credential has no fixed name.** `ASSISTANT_ENV_KEYS` becomes
  `assistantEnvKeys(compute)`: the static keys plus exactly the secrets this
  install's `compute.yaml` declares, so it stays an allowlist while the variable
  it admits is whatever the file names. A provider key in the operator's shell
  that the file does not name still cannot reach the engine. The sandbox
  profile's documented host list is derived the same way (`engineHosts`) instead
  of naming one vendor; what is actually enforced is unchanged and restated —
  the loop's only outbound call is `<base_url>/chat/completions` on the assigned
  provider.
  
  **The Mac app's step 7 becomes Compute.** Pick a template (OpenRouter,
  OpenCode Zen, LM Studio, Ollama, bundled local), name a model, paste the key
  into a secure field, and the app runs `metistry compute providers add --from
  … --json` with the key on the child's **stdin** — the one exception to the
  app's empty-stdin rule, and why `CommandRunner` grew a `standardInput`
  parameter — then `metistry compute assign default <provider/model> --json`.
  The property holding the key is cleared before the process runs, and tests
  assert the key is in no argument of any call. "Skip: no engine yet" is a real
  choice with its consequence on screen. Settings' "Claude Token" row becomes
  **Compute**, rendering `metistry compute show --json`: the default assignment,
  each provider, and whether the key each one *names* is present — never a
  value.
  
  `collectors/claude-usage` is **kept**, unchanged in behaviour: it is a local
  rollup of `runs` needing no credential, so it degrades to nothing on an
  engine-less install; its `claude.*` metric names are data existing installs
  already carry and renaming them would be a migration with no reader benefit.
  Its copy, `seed/queries/claude_usage_daily.yaml`'s description and the weekly
  review's monthly block stop describing a plan's headroom and describe what the
  provider billed.

### Minor Changes

- f6c0eee: **One background item, and it is called Metistry.** macOS shows one background
  item per launchd agent, named after its program, so the launchd shape used to
  introduce itself in System Settings as "postgres", "node", "node", "node" —
  `sfltool dumpbtm` said `Executable Path: /bin/sh` four times over. Under that
  shape the core is now a single agent, `com.foldedspacelabs.metistry`, whose
  program is a symlink named `Metistry`.
  
  - **The watchdog grew into the supervisor.** It runs Postgres, the console, the
    reconciler, the assistant (still rooted at `sandbox-exec`, same profile, same
    parameters — proved live: a vault read denied, a write outside the state dir
    denied, a write inside allowed, its own console and db allowed, another
    install's console and reconciler denied) and any configured bridge as its
    children, with ordered start behind a readiness probe (Postgres answers →
    console → the rest), per-child exponential backoff, crash-loop detection that
    is *reported* rather than hammered, per-child logs at the same
    `/tmp/metistry-<service>.log` paths, and SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL in reverse
    order. Its probes and presence feed are unchanged and in the same process —
    invariant 3's sole exception did not move.
  - **`metistry restart|stop|start <service>`** reaches those children over a
    0600 unix socket in the instance's state dir, because launchctl cannot
    address a process launchd has never heard of; launchctl stays for the
    supervisor and the TCC helpers. Requests are authenticated with a token
    anyway (invariant 8), and the misuse tests ship with the interface. `doctor`
    asks the supervisor for a row per child.
  - **Everything macOS shows carries the Metistry name.** The EventKit helper's
    agent is `com.foldedspacelabs.metistry.calendar` and its bundle is displayed
    as "Metistry Calendar Access"; the Apple FM helper's is "Metistry Apple
    Intelligence". Their **bundle identifiers and signing identifiers are
    untouched** — TCC keys a grant on bundle id plus certificate chain, so no
    install has to consent again.
  - **A running install migrates in place.** `metistry up` boots out the
    pre-supervisor agents once and deletes their plists before installing the
    supervisor, so nothing runs twice; `migrate-shape launchd` produces the new
    set directly. The compose shape is untouched apart from that one rename.
  - **A bridge is installed only when it is configured** (its `METISTRY_*_URL` is
    set) — the signal `doctor` already read, and the end of "`up` installs every
    plist in `ops/launchd` regardless".
  - **`metistry up --register-via app`** leaves the one agent to the Mac app,
    which registers the copy embedded in its bundle through
    `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` — what nests it under the app in Login Items
    instead of listing it beside.

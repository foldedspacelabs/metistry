# @foldedspacelabs/metistry-core

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f6c0eee: **One background item, and it is called Metistry.** macOS shows one background
  item per launchd agent, named after its program, so the launchd shape used to
  introduce itself in System Settings as "postgres", "node", "node", "node" —
  `sfltool dumpbtm` said `Executable Path: /bin/sh` four times over. Under that
  shape the core is now a single agent, `com.foldedspacelabs.metistry`, whose
  program is a symlink named `Metistry`.
  
  - **The watchdog grew into the supervisor.** It runs Postgres, the console, the
    reconciler, the assistant (still rooted at `sandbox-exec`, same profile, same
    parameters — proved live: a vault read denied, a write outside the state dir
    denied, a write inside allowed, its own console and db allowed, another
    install's console and reconciler denied) and any configured bridge as its
    children, with ordered start behind a readiness probe (Postgres answers →
    console → the rest), per-child exponential backoff, crash-loop detection that
    is *reported* rather than hammered, per-child logs at the same
    `/tmp/metistry-<service>.log` paths, and SIGTERM-then-SIGKILL in reverse
    order. Its probes and presence feed are unchanged and in the same process —
    invariant 3's sole exception did not move.
  - **`metistry restart|stop|start <service>`** reaches those children over a
    0600 unix socket in the instance's state dir, because launchctl cannot
    address a process launchd has never heard of; launchctl stays for the
    supervisor and the TCC helpers. Requests are authenticated with a token
    anyway (invariant 8), and the misuse tests ship with the interface. `doctor`
    asks the supervisor for a row per child.
  - **Everything macOS shows carries the Metistry name.** The EventKit helper's
    agent is `com.foldedspacelabs.metistry.calendar` and its bundle is displayed
    as "Metistry Calendar Access"; the Apple FM helper's is "Metistry Apple
    Intelligence". Their **bundle identifiers and signing identifiers are
    untouched** — TCC keys a grant on bundle id plus certificate chain, so no
    install has to consent again.
  - **A running install migrates in place.** `metistry up` boots out the
    pre-supervisor agents once and deletes their plists before installing the
    supervisor, so nothing runs twice; `migrate-shape launchd` produces the new
    set directly. The compose shape is untouched apart from that one rename.
  - **A bridge is installed only when it is configured** (its `METISTRY_*_URL` is
    set) — the signal `doctor` already read, and the end of "`up` installs every
    plist in `ops/launchd` regardless".
  - **`metistry up --register-via app`** leaves the one agent to the Mac app,
    which registers the copy embedded in its bundle through
    `SMAppService.agent(plistName:)` — what nests it under the app in Login Items
    instead of listing it beside.

### Minor Changes

- c32b27d: Add `tasks_close` — the vocabulary fix deferred from the 2026-09-09 rename
  (`docs/product/glossary.md` lists tasks' own verbs as `claim · renew ·
  release · close`, but closing went through `tasks_update {status:
  "closed"}`). `tasks_close` is a thin wrapper over the same `tasks.update`
  host handler (`id`, optional `note`) — no new DB path. `tasks_update`
  keeps `status: closed` working for compatibility; its description now
  points callers at `tasks_close` for finishing a task in one call.
  `tasks_close` joins the `tasks` crew tool group (`CREW_TOOL_GROUPS` in
  core) alongside the other holder verbs, and the assistant's `BRAIN_TOOLS`
  allowlist. The eager surface is now 23 tools, 18,369 chars ≈ 4.6k
  definition tokens — still well under PoC-17's 5k-token lazy-discovery
  line.

## 0.3.1

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- ea541bc: Tiers are (model, effort) pairs, and sessions end at task boundaries. `core`
  gains `tiers.ts` — the schema for a `tiers:` block, the `default`/`routine`
  names, and the one resolver that turns a tier NAME into a pair (an unknown
  name lands on `default`, never on an invented model) — and `session-roll.ts`,
  which marks a thread's active sessions `rolled` so the next turn starts a
  fresh SDK session and logs one `runs` row with the reason and the turn count.
  The `agent` manifest gains an optional `effort` (`low | medium | high`,
  default `low`), so a crew declares the other half of its tier; a manifest
  without it keeps working, cheaply. Rationale and figures:
  `docs/research/2026-09-cost-optimization.md`, decisions 2 and 3.
- 92dd868: Session summaries as a capture source (stash review item 2). `core` gains a
  deterministic Claude Code transcript summariser — turns, duration, files
  touched, tools with counts, models, first prompt and last response, both
  clipped — plus the `kind: session` note it renders and a content-derived
  `idempotency_key`. `cli` gains `metistry import-sessions [--since] [--project]
  [--limit] [--dry-run]`, which posts those summaries to `/capture` from the
  host, skipping anything a ledger at `~/.metistry/imported-sessions.json`
  already sent. No model is called on either side, and a transcript is never
  posted — only its summary.
- Knowledge fold (the evening turn that turns accepted items into Journal and entity pages), `import-sessions` and `kind: session` captures, `knowledge_list`/`knowledge_grep` and vault notes as MCP resources under one scope helper, the simplified vocabulary (22 primary tools with call-time aliases; Approve / Revise / Decline; Auto / Supervised), cost discipline ((model, effort) tiers, session roll at task boundaries, cache read/write metrics and a prompt lint), the bundled runtime build (Node, Postgres 17 + pgvector, git — signed), TCC helpers as signed app bundles whose grants survive rebuilds, Sparkle tooling pinned, npm Trusted Publishing, and the GitHub OAuth App shipped as the default for `connect-repo`.
- ad185f2: One vocabulary everywhere. Eight nouns (knowledge, capture, request, task,
  artifact, project, agent, activity) and one verb set per object, in the UI, the
  notifications, the briefs and the tool names. Eleven brain tools were renamed —
  `report` → `requests_create`, `tasks_list_ready` + `tasks_mine` → `tasks_list
  {filter}`, `tasks_heartbeat` → `tasks_renew`, `artifact_*` → `artifacts_*`,
  `crew_dispatch` → `agents_delegate` — and the old spellings keep working for one
  release (resolved at call time, recorded in `runs.meta.alias`, not listed by
  `tools/list`). In the console, Needs You now reads Approve / Revise / Decline
  and project mode reads Auto / Supervised. `docs/product/glossary.md` is the one
  page that holds the vocabulary.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 66d5c08: `queries_list` / `queries_run` on mcp-brain — invariant 3's one read path
  (named, parameterized queries, never free-form SQL) out to agents. An
  agent lists what's available (name, description, param types/defaults)
  and runs one, capped at 200 rows with truncation noted. The instance's
  own assistant always has it; an external agent needs an explicit
  `queries: true` grant (`PUT /api/agents/:id/grants`), a separate axis
  from the knowledge tier.
  
  Every mcp-brain tool also now takes an optional `turn_id` (≤ 64 chars,
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`), recorded on the tool's `runs` row (`meta.turn_id`); the
  `activity_feed` query surfaces it so one reply's tool calls group
  together. The seed assistant prompt tells it to generate one per reply.
  
  Crews never get `queries_list`/`queries_run` — a named query is not
  filtered by a crew's scope/projects the way every other tool group is.
- 4774e08: Phase 6 — embeddings on reconcile, and semantic search behind the same
  grants.
  
  The reconciler embeds settled notes as it reconciles (local Ollama
  `nomic-embed-text`, model and dim per row) and gains
  `POST /embeddings/rebuild`. `GET /vault/search` and mcp-brain's
  `knowledge_search` take `mode=keyword|semantic|hybrid`, defaulting to
  hybrid once vectors exist and keyword before that. Every mode keeps the
  grant tier and the draft exclusion in SQL. With no embedder running,
  search still answers in keyword and the index is unaffected.
  
  Migration 0012 adds `knowledge_files.embedded_hash` / `embedded_model`
  (additive, derived).
- fc0b525: `parseDecisionBlock` — the question-answer convention (§4.21). A reply whose
  last block is a fenced ```decision block (a `title:` line plus two to eight
  `options:`) is a blocking question; the emitter parses it where the reply is
  stored and turns it into one queue item. Strict by design — a malformed block
  parses to null and is ignored, so the shape is all a model can put in front of
  the user.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First tagged release: Phases 1–5. Substrate (Postgres + migrations), the web door (passkeys, PWA, web push), capture (inbox-drain with the on-device Apple FM tier), visibility (github-state, aws-costs, claude-usage collectors; dashboard, feed, morning brief, weekly review), and delegation (tasks, agent registry with grants, mcp-brain, reconciler as sole committer, artifacts with review bundles, crews, targets with data policy, projects with the review-mode kill switch). CLI: init, doctor, up, update (git and release channels). Deployment shapes: compose and launchd (sandboxed assistant).

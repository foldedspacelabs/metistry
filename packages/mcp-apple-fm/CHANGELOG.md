### Minor Changes

- 70f6580: **Apple Foundation Models is now a compute provider, and `inbox-drain` calls
  it through the same wire as everything else.** The `apple-fm` bridge grows
  `GET /v1/models` and `POST /v1/chat/completions` on its existing loopback
  listener, under the same bearer as every other bridge route — with
  `response_format: json_schema` translated per request into Apple's
  `DynamicGenerationSchema`, real token counts from the model's own tokenizer,
  and a `400` that names the field when a schema or prompt would not fit the
  4096-token window. `metistry compute providers add --from applefm` writes the
  provider; discovery and `metistry doctor` gain a `local:applefm` row.
  
  `inbox-drain` no longer reaches the bridge's private `/classify` route. It
  declares `uses_model: applefm/foundation-model` in its manifest and goes
  through `completeJson()`, which enforces the rule that a collector may only
  call an on-machine, cost-0 provider — CI checks the shipped default, and the
  call itself throws rather than spending. **Upgrading:** run `metistry compute
  providers add --from applefm` (with
  `--base-url http://host.docker.internal:7810/v1` in the container shape) to
  keep the model tier; without it the drain is deterministic, which is a
  supported install and which `metistry doctor` reports.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- c6eb8ff: The helper build scripts pick a Developer ID identity by its SHA-1 hash
  instead of its display name, so a keychain holding two certs with the same
  name (a renewal, a second import) no longer fails `codesign` with
  "ambiguous". Duplicates of one team are tolerated; certs for different teams
  stop the build and ask for `METISTRY_SIGN_IDENTITY`. The chosen hash and
  name are printed.

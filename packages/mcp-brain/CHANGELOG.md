## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- f57b3b0: **The instance directory is the Obsidian vault.** Open the folder `metistry
  init` made and your notes are right there — `Journal/`, `Me/`, `Inbox/`,
  `now.md` — with nothing of the machinery in the way. Everything that is not
  knowledge moved into `.metistry/`: identity, rules, compute, the config
  directories, the lock, and the derived `state/` that holds Postgres, the
  `.env` and downloaded models. Obsidian ignores dot-prefixed folders, which is
  the whole reason for the dot — the vault root and the install's own files can
  finally be the same directory without one of them cluttering the other.
  
  Vault paths lose their prefix with it: a note is `Areas/Fsl/Drey.md`, a
  capture is `Inbox/…`, and a read grant covering everything is spelled `/`.
  
  **The protected set became a place rather than a list.** Anything under
  `.metistry/` is the user's hand alone — except `.metistry/state/`, which is
  derived and nobody's record — plus the root `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`.
  That is one rule the reconciler enforces at the tool, instead of seven
  filenames each component had to remember. Neither those two root files nor
  `Artifacts/` are indexed as knowledge: your instructions and your bundles are
  yours to read, not search results.
  
  This ships the layout for NEW instances. An existing instance keeps working
  unchanged and `metistry doctor` now says which shape it is in; the verb that
  moves one is the next change.

### Patch Changes

- 76f82a2: **An instance that has not run `metistry migrate-layout` is read again.**
  `db/migrations/0021` recorded that "a legacy instance keeps working unchanged
  until the verb runs". Verified against a clone of a real pre-ruling instance,
  it did not: #193 moved every path to `.metistry/` and every reader spelled the
  new one, so `metistry compute show` reported no providers while the instance's
  `compute.yaml` declared one, `metistry identity` exited 1 on an instance whose
  `identity.yaml` was right there, `metistry version` omitted the pin, `doctor`
  read `shape compose` off a `deployment.yaml` it never opened and probed the
  wrong half of the install, `metistry secrets`/`console`/`connect` could not
  find `state/.env` at all — which on a launchd install means every rendered
  plist's `__ENV_FILE__` points at a file that does not exist — and `up` would
  have `initdb`'d a second, empty Postgres cluster at `.metistry/state/pg`
  beside the live one.
  
  Two of the breaks were safety, not convenience. The §4.7 protected set became
  the `.metistry/` PLACE, which took the legacy machinery at the instance root
  out of it: on a legacy instance the assistant could write `identity.yaml`,
  `rules.yaml`, `metistry.lock`, `queries/` and `instance-migrations/` through
  `brain-commit` (invariant 2). And the knowledge walk, which now starts at the
  instance root, indexed those same files plus every byte of the gitignored
  `state/` — a Postgres cluster included — as notes.
  
  `resolveInstanceLayout(instanceDir)` in core is the fix: one `detectLayout`
  read, then the right relative-path table (`LEGACY_INSTANCE_LAYOUT` mirrors
  `INSTANCE_LAYOUT` key for key), with `instanceFile()` / `instanceStatePath()`
  as the reader's one-line call. Every reader goes through it — identity,
  rules, compute, deployment, the lock, the peer registry, `.env`, the Postgres
  data and socket dirs, the supervisor's config/socket/bin, `ports.yaml`, the
  models dir, the assistant's state dir, `doctor`'s compute overlay, the
  console's identity/peers/inbox, and the reconciler's inbox prefix (whose SQL
  predicate must match migration 0015's partial index on a legacy instance, not
  0021's). Writers are untouched: `instancePath`/`metistryPath` still spell the
  flat layout, because there is one layout to write and two to read.
  `isProtectedPath` and `isVaultPath` cover the legacy root names
  unconditionally — they receive a path and no instance directory, and the set
  is strictly safer on a flat instance, which has no business holding lowercase
  machinery at its root.
  
  `metistry update` now **refuses** to pin a version past 0.8.x onto a legacy
  instance, before it fetches, builds or migrates anything, printing the
  `migrate-layout` line to run; `--allow-legacy` overrides. Regression tests run
  one fixture in both shapes through the same readers, so a reader that resolves
  only one of them fails.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 6aa64c2: **Approve now does something on an `action`.** `action` was a word in the
  console's view map that nothing emitted; it is now a request kind carrying a
  **closed** `payload.action = {kind, args}` — exactly four kinds
  (`dispatch`, `task_update`, `comment`, `capture`), held in `packages/core` as
  data plus a zod schema each, so an unknown kind or an unnamed argument is a
  `400` naming the field. Allowing one runs it through the *same service call the
  owner's own click makes* (`dispatch()`, `TasksService.update()`,
  `workComment()`, `captureToInbox()`), as the `user` principal, with the
  proposal's `source_agent` recorded as `on_behalf_of` and the result written
  back to `payload.result`. A refusal leaves the row **pending** carrying the
  error — and nothing is half-applied, because one action is one service call.
  No sending, no git, no shell, no grants: every kind is a door onto something
  the console could already do, never a new power (taskuary review ADOPT 6).
  
  **Autonomy levels, and widening is now allowed — by your hand only** (A3 /
  OPEN-2). `agents.autonomy` gains `{level: observe | propose |
  act_within_scope, actions: {<kind>: allow | propose | deny}}` beside the §4.21
  narrowing keys, so one record answers both "how much room" and "which action".
  The level is a **ceiling** and the per-kind entry the value — the effective
  mode is the lower of the two, which is what makes "it only ever runs on its own
  at `act_within_scope`" arithmetic rather than a rule that could be forgotten.
  Defaults: everything `deny` at `observe` (**and with no level at all**, so this
  release widens nobody), everything `propose` at `propose`, and
  `comment`/`capture`/`task_update` `allow` at `act_within_scope` while
  `dispatch` stays `propose` — off-machine is a human decision by default. A
  change that raises anything is admitted only through `PUT
  /api/agents/:id/autonomy` (the `user` principal) and the new `metistry agents
  autonomy <id> --level … --allow <kind>`; every other caller is narrowing-only
  by default, and every raise writes a `runs` row `agent_admin` /
  `autonomy_widened` plus one Needs You alert, so a raised bar is never silent.
  
  **`propose_action` in mcp-brain**, in its own crew grant group `actions` (the
  same opt-in rule `rooms` follows). It answers `executed` or `pending`; a denied
  kind is a `forbidden` envelope naming `autonomy.actions.<kind>`. Registration
  is **lazy by credential**: an agent whose table admits nothing is not offered
  the tool, which is every agent until you set a level — so the eager definition
  surface stays at 25 tools / ~4.9k tokens for everyone, and an opted-in
  principal carries 26 knowingly. Deferring on the credential costs none of the
  +1 discovery turn a meta-tool index would.
  
  Needs You renders an action's kind, argument preview, reason and result; the
  Agents panel shows each agent's level and resolved table with widen/narrow
  controls. `docs/ops/actions.md` is the whole design.
- 6fd4c28: The console's API contract for a client that is not always connected
  (`docs/ops/console-api.md`, from the 2026-09-11 research note): a public
  `GET /api/identity` (`instance_id`, `name`, `icon`, `version` — read from
  `identity.yaml` through `METISTRY_IDENTITY_FILES`, 503 when absent) so a
  phone can name an instance before sign-in and recognise it after its origin
  moves; an `Idempotency-Key` header on `POST /capture`, scoped to the
  credential class, that returns the original row on replay — one file, one
  inbox row even when attempts race (migration `0014`, unique index on the
  inbox row) — with `Idempotency-Replayed: true`; `409 conflict` carrying the
  winning decision when a proposal was already settled (unknown stays `404`);
  and opaque `since` cursors on `GET /api/messages` and `GET /api/proposals`
  (`cursor`, `more`), where a rating moves a message and a decision moves a
  proposal, so a reconnect after hours is one bounded pull per list. The
  plain lists are unchanged.
- 367f456: **Rooms: a conversation can now hang on a task, not only on a deliverable.**
  A comment thread anchors to a `work` row as well as an artifact version
  (migration `0018` — one nullable `work_id`, a check constraint enforcing
  exactly one parent, and one room per row), so agents can negotiate scope
  before anything is published. Two new tools, `tasks_comment {work_id, body}`
  and `tasks_thread {work_id}`, under the same project grant as `tasks_*`.
  
  **A room cannot address anyone** — no `to_agent`, no `@name`, no addressee
  field anywhere on the path — so posting wakes nobody and triggering stays with
  `agents_delegate`. Because it is the same table, the shipped escalation
  applies unchanged: ten consecutive agent messages and the next one is not
  stored; the room becomes an owner item with its transcript, and a human
  message resets the run. **Resolving is the owner's hand alone**: one console
  route, no tool, and nothing on a timer.
  
  Also: a **Rooms** tab listing every conversation across both anchors, with the
  escalation reason rendered as a sentence; the last of a task's room riding
  along in a crew's brief under `METISTRY_BRIEF_THREAD_BYTES` (default 4096);
  and `proposals.work_id`, set server-side, so a proposal can finally say which
  work row it came from.
  
  Crews reach the new tools through a new `rooms` group in `uses` — its own
  group rather than part of `tasks`, so no existing crew gains the ability to
  speak without a manifest edit.

### Patch Changes

- cde0691: **The inbox moved inside the vault, and human edits became first-class.**
  Captures live at `Knowledge/Inbox/` — Obsidian's vault root is `Knowledge/`,
  so that is the only place it can see them, add to them and edit them — and
  they are tracked, so git carries them: the inbox used to be the one thing a
  `docker compose down -v` rebuild could not bring back (invariant 1).
  `docs/ops/inbox.md`.
  
  - **One sink, every door.** `POST /capture`, the `/note` fast path, the
    bridge's `capture` tool and the collectors all write through the
    reconciler's vault bridge with `expected_sha256: ""` — must not exist — so
    a capture can never land on a file someone already wrote. The console still
    holds no part of the instance repo (D5, invariant 7), and each capture is a
    commit. With no bridge configured it degrades to a plain directory: capture
    keeps working, and moving those files into `Knowledge/Inbox/` later is
    enough for the scan below to pick them up.
  - **Files you write yourself are indexed.** The reconcile loop already walks
    the vault by content hash, so it now also reconciles `Knowledge/Inbox/`: a
    note you added in Obsidian gets a triage row, an edit to a capture
    refreshes its hash and — if it had already been classified or accepted —
    sends it back to `inbox-drain`, because a refinement is new information. A
    `rejected` row stays rejected; a deleted file archives its row rather than
    losing it; the file coming back re-opens it. No new watcher, no new
    component talking to Postgres (invariant 3).
  - **`knowledge_write` can no longer overwrite a note it has not seen.**
    Omitting `expected_sha256` used to mean "unconditional", which meant an
    edit *you* made to a page the assistant owns could vanish with no conflict
    and no trace but the commit. It now means create-only: an existing note
    answers `conflict` with the current hash, so changing a note requires
    `knowledge_read` first. Misuse test ships with it.
  - **Big captures.** Above `METISTRY_INBOX_MAX_TRACKED_BYTES` (5 MiB) a
    capture goes to `Knowledge/Inbox/.large/`, which the instance gitignores:
    Obsidian still sees a 40 MB screen recording, the repo does not carry it.
  - **`metistry migrate-inbox`** moves an existing instance — files (`git mv`
    for what git tracks), `.gitignore`, and `inbox.path` rows to the
    repo-relative form `db/migrations/0001_init.sql` always documented — with
    `--dry-run`, idempotent, restarting nothing. A second instance that already
    moved its inbox to a lowercase `Knowledge/inbox/` is renamed through a temp
    name, because macOS is case-insensitive and `git mv` would otherwise move
    the directory inside itself.
  
  Migration `0015_inbox_in_vault.sql` is additive: a partial unique index makes
  "one row per inbox file" true at the database, since the capture path and the
  scan both reach that directory now.
- 23d72db: **Four rulings from 2026-09-17, each one closing an open question rather than
  adding a surface.**
  
  **One cloud template ships (OPEN-7).** `seed/compute-templates/zen.yaml` is
  gone: a seeded template is a promise to keep a base URL, a price table and a
  retention claim true, and OpenCode Zen's were ours to chase. `openrouter` is
  the one cloud; Zen and every other OpenAI-compatible provider is reached the
  way `compute.yaml` always allowed — a hand-written `providers:` block, or
  `--base-url` over the nearest template. `COMPUTE_TEMPLATES` and the Mac app's
  picker both lose the entry, and the C13 non-ZDR warning is now proved against
  a hand-written cloud, because no shipped template is non-ZDR any more.
  
  **`critical: true` belongs on `assignments.default` (OPEN-4).** The flag was
  already enforced; what carries it was open. The seed now marks the default
  assignment, with the consequence written beside it: under a budget's
  `action: critical_only` the turn you are waiting on keeps being answered while
  routines and delegation stop. The mark travels with the assignment, so
  `tiers.routine` has to stay declared for the pause to reach the evening fold —
  the seed says so, and a test uncomments the seed's own example to prove it.
  
  **The board's Assigned column is read "Addressed to" (OPEN-5).**
  `work.owner` is informational — a name on the card, not a lease; the lease is
  `claimed_by`, and claiming is what moves a row to In Progress. A rename of
  what the user reads only: the derived value stays `assigned`, so every drop's
  route, board.yaml and the `runs` ledger are untouched, and a new test pins the
  label and the key apart.
  
  **`agents_delegate` advertises each crew's description (H8).** The assistant
  saw crew names and nothing else, so which helper fitted a brief was guesswork
  the registry corrected by refusal — after the brief was written.
  `CrewDispatcher.names(): string[]` becomes `crews(): CrewSummary[]`, and the
  `crew` field's description now carries `<name> — <description>` from each
  manifest. It is in the tool definition rather than a prompt line, so it
  travels to whichever model `compute.yaml` assigned, and it is read off the
  registry at registration, so an edited manifest lands on the next call rather
  than the next restart. Capped at 20 crews and 120 characters each: the roster
  is spent out of the same definition-token budget the eager surface is measured
  against.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- c32b27d: Add `tasks_close` — the vocabulary fix deferred from the 2026-09-09 rename
  (`docs/product/glossary.md` lists tasks' own verbs as `claim · renew ·
  release · close`, but closing went through `tasks_update {status:
  "closed"}`). `tasks_close` is a thin wrapper over the same `tasks.update`
  host handler (`id`, optional `note`) — no new DB path. `tasks_update`
  keeps `status: closed` working for compatibility; its description now
  points callers at `tasks_close` for finishing a task in one call.
  `tasks_close` joins the `tasks` crew tool group (`CREW_TOOL_GROUPS` in
  core) alongside the other holder verbs, and the assistant's `BRAIN_TOOLS`
  allowlist. The eager surface is now 23 tools, 18,369 chars ≈ 4.6k
  definition tokens — still well under PoC-17's 5k-token lazy-discovery
  line.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c07a12c: `knowledge_write` now enforces ownership as well as authorship: an update to
  an existing markdown note whose frontmatter `source` is neither the caller's
  own id nor `knowledge-fold` is refused (`forbidden: owned by <source>; propose
  instead`). New notes are unaffected, and `source` is still stamped from the
  credential rather than the argument, so "notes I wrote" stays a fact rather
  than a claim. Hosts pass their vault reader as the new optional fifth argument
  to `writeKnowledge` (the brain server wires `cfg.readKnowledge` through
  automatically); when a read fails the write is refused rather than waved
  through. `ownershipRefusal` and `frontmatterSource` are exported.
- Knowledge fold (the evening turn that turns accepted items into Journal and entity pages), `import-sessions` and `kind: session` captures, `knowledge_list`/`knowledge_grep` and vault notes as MCP resources under one scope helper, the simplified vocabulary (22 primary tools with call-time aliases; Approve / Revise / Decline; Auto / Supervised), cost discipline ((model, effort) tiers, session roll at task boundaries, cache read/write metrics and a prompt lint), the bundled runtime build (Node, Postgres 17 + pgvector, git — signed), TCC helpers as signed app bundles whose grants survive rebuilds, Sparkle tooling pinned, npm Trusted Publishing, and the GitHub OAuth App shipped as the default for `connect-repo`.
- ad185f2: One vocabulary everywhere. Eight nouns (knowledge, capture, request, task,
  artifact, project, agent, activity) and one verb set per object, in the UI, the
  notifications, the briefs and the tool names. Eleven brain tools were renamed —
  `report` → `requests_create`, `tasks_list_ready` + `tasks_mine` → `tasks_list
  {filter}`, `tasks_heartbeat` → `tasks_renew`, `artifact_*` → `artifacts_*`,
  `crew_dispatch` → `agents_delegate` — and the old spellings keep working for one
  release (resolved at call time, recorded in `runs.meta.alias`, not listed by
  `tools/list`). In the console, Needs You now reads Approve / Revise / Decline
  and project mode reads Auto / Supervised. `docs/product/glossary.md` is the one
  page that holds the vocabulary.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 66d5c08: `queries_list` / `queries_run` on mcp-brain — invariant 3's one read path
  (named, parameterized queries, never free-form SQL) out to agents. An
  agent lists what's available (name, description, param types/defaults)
  and runs one, capped at 200 rows with truncation noted. The instance's
  own assistant always has it; an external agent needs an explicit
  `queries: true` grant (`PUT /api/agents/:id/grants`), a separate axis
  from the knowledge tier.
  
  Every mcp-brain tool also now takes an optional `turn_id` (≤ 64 chars,
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`), recorded on the tool's `runs` row (`meta.turn_id`); the
  `activity_feed` query surfaces it so one reply's tool calls group
  together. The seed assistant prompt tells it to generate one per reply.
  
  Crews never get `queries_list`/`queries_run` — a named query is not
  filtered by a crew's scope/projects the way every other tool group is.
- 4774e08: Phase 6 — embeddings on reconcile, and semantic search behind the same
  grants.
  
  The reconciler embeds settled notes as it reconciles (local Ollama
  `nomic-embed-text`, model and dim per row) and gains
  `POST /embeddings/rebuild`. `GET /vault/search` and mcp-brain's
  `knowledge_search` take `mode=keyword|semantic|hybrid`, defaulting to
  hybrid once vectors exist and keyword before that. Every mode keeps the
  grant tier and the draft exclusion in SQL. With no embedder running,
  search still answers in keyword and the index is unaffected.
  
  Migration 0012 adds `knowledge_files.embedded_hash` / `embedded_model`
  (additive, derived).
- Phase 5 complete and the desktop direction: crews (manifest-defined sub-agents with per-run scoped tokens and a local target), projects with the `mode: autonomous | review` kill switch, bundle caps, daily budgets and narrowing, the activity feed and agent presence in the PWA, the design system (tokens, components, wireframes) and the PWA restyle (iMessage-style composer with a collapsed actions menu, autocomplete for `@agents` and `/commands`, scroll preservation, reply-text density), reply tapbacks with a daily reply-review that proposes prompt improvements, Needs You as the single actionable list including the assistant's blocking questions, `queries_list`/`queries_run` over named queries with a `turn_id` join key, Phase 6 embeddings and hybrid search, `metistry connect-repo` and `secrets`, the launchd deployment shape with a sandboxed assistant, release notes from the CHANGELOG, and Developer ID signing of the Swift helpers.

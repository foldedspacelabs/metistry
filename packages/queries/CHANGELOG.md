### Minor Changes

- 66d5c08: `queries_list` / `queries_run` on mcp-brain — invariant 3's one read path
  (named, parameterized queries, never free-form SQL) out to agents. An
  agent lists what's available (name, description, param types/defaults)
  and runs one, capped at 200 rows with truncation noted. The instance's
  own assistant always has it; an external agent needs an explicit
  `queries: true` grant (`PUT /api/agents/:id/grants`), a separate axis
  from the knowledge tier.
  
  Every mcp-brain tool also now takes an optional `turn_id` (≤ 64 chars,
  `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`), recorded on the tool's `runs` row (`meta.turn_id`); the
  `activity_feed` query surfaces it so one reply's tool calls group
  together. The seed assistant prompt tells it to generate one per reply.
  
  Crews never get `queries_list`/`queries_run` — a named query is not
  filtered by a crew's scope/projects the way every other tool group is.

### Minor Changes

- First tagged release: Phases 1–5. Substrate (Postgres + migrations), the web door (passkeys, PWA, web push), capture (inbox-drain with the on-device Apple FM tier), visibility (github-state, aws-costs, claude-usage collectors; dashboard, feed, morning brief, weekly review), and delegation (tasks, agent registry with grants, mcp-brain, reconciler as sole committer, artifacts with review bundles, crews, targets with data policy, projects with the review-mode kill switch). CLI: init, doctor, up, update (git and release channels). Deployment shapes: compose and launchd (sandboxed assistant).

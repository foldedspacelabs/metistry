### Minor Changes

- d21f953: **The product no longer ships a claude.ai-login path or the Claude Agent SDK;
  compute is configured in `compute.yaml`.** One engine remains — the
  OpenAI-compatible loop — and Claude is reached through OpenRouter like any
  other cloud model (owner's decision, `docs/plan-refresh-2026-09-13.md` C2/C3).
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` leaves every `package.json` and the lockfile;
  `engine-sdk.ts`, the `anthropic` engine kind and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` are
  gone from the engine, the CLI's env allowlist and secret table, the plists,
  `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example` and the docs. Version bumps are `minor`
  across the fixed set rather than `major` because fixed mode moves every package
  together and a major here would say something about packages this does not
  touch; the behaviour change is stated here, in `docs/ops/compute.md` and in
  `docs/ops/assistant-tools.md` ("Running without an engine").
  
  **"Is there an engine" is now one seam over two facts.** `engineStatus(compute,
  env)` in `packages/core/src/compute.ts` replaces `engineCredentialPresent(env)`:
  an engine is an `assignments.default` *and* the key its provider names in
  `providers.<name>.auth.secret`. `metistry up` (whether the assistant is a
  supervisor child), `metistry doctor` (the `assistant` row), the routine
  runner's preflight (`requires.engine`) and — through the supervisor's child
  list — the watchdog all read it, so they cannot disagree; each refusal names
  the missing half and the verb that fixes it. `makeEngine` throws a named
  `NoEngineError` for a turn nothing assigns rather than inventing one, and the
  drain never starts: an install with no assignment behaves exactly as #145 made
  it, with captures, tasks, search and the console running and queued turns
  waiting. **Both deployment shapes now run engine-less** — `docker-compose.yml`
  no longer interpolates a credential as required.
  
  **The engine's credential has no fixed name.** `ASSISTANT_ENV_KEYS` becomes
  `assistantEnvKeys(compute)`: the static keys plus exactly the secrets this
  install's `compute.yaml` declares, so it stays an allowlist while the variable
  it admits is whatever the file names. A provider key in the operator's shell
  that the file does not name still cannot reach the engine. The sandbox
  profile's documented host list is derived the same way (`engineHosts`) instead
  of naming one vendor; what is actually enforced is unchanged and restated —
  the loop's only outbound call is `<base_url>/chat/completions` on the assigned
  provider.
  
  **The Mac app's step 7 becomes Compute.** Pick a template (OpenRouter,
  OpenCode Zen, LM Studio, Ollama, bundled local), name a model, paste the key
  into a secure field, and the app runs `metistry compute providers add --from
  … --json` with the key on the child's **stdin** — the one exception to the
  app's empty-stdin rule, and why `CommandRunner` grew a `standardInput`
  parameter — then `metistry compute assign default <provider/model> --json`.
  The property holding the key is cleared before the process runs, and tests
  assert the key is in no argument of any call. "Skip: no engine yet" is a real
  choice with its consequence on screen. Settings' "Claude Token" row becomes
  **Compute**, rendering `metistry compute show --json`: the default assignment,
  each provider, and whether the key each one *names* is present — never a
  value.
  
  `collectors/claude-usage` is **kept**, unchanged in behaviour: it is a local
  rollup of `runs` needing no credential, so it degrades to nothing on an
  engine-less install; its `claude.*` metric names are data existing installs
  already carry and renaming them would be a migration with no reader benefit.
  Its copy, `seed/queries/claude_usage_daily.yaml`'s description and the weekly
  review's monthly block stop describing a plan's headroom and describe what the
  provider billed.

### Patch Changes

- 26df04d: **The Feed is a timeline, and a capture is on it the instant it lands.** The
  `activity_feed` query gains an `inbox` branch, so a note taken on the phone
  shows up immediately wearing its own status (`new` = still waiting on the
  drain) rather than appearing five minutes later as a proposal — the loop's one
  accidental latency. Every row now carries a coarse `group` (capture, proposal,
  decision, run, work, message) decided in the SQL, which the panel renders as
  filter chips; `since` pulls only what is new, and a decision event says what
  you answered, not just that something was answered. Still read-only.
  
  **Approve as Work.** A `knowledge` or `report` proposal whose payload carries
  `suggested_work` shows one extra answer, and the click inserts the `work` row,
  links it as `proposals.work_id` and allows the proposal. `inbox-drain` sets the
  suggestion deterministically — frontmatter `kind: todo|task`, a leading
  `@task` / `todo:` / `- [ ]`, or the `todo` verdict its rules already reached;
  **no model**, and the Apple FM tier's `has_action` is deliberately not an
  input. Nothing auto-creates: §4.12 holds because a human clicked. The row is
  born owner-less and unclaimed, so any agent may take it, and the insert is
  keyed on the proposal id so a double-tap cannot make two.
  
  **A decision is an answer to the row you were shown.** `POST
  /api/proposals/:id` accepts `if_unchanged: {seen_at}`; if the proposal moved
  after that — payload rewritten, its linked work row touched, a message in that
  row's room — nothing is decided and a `409` comes back carrying
  `reason: "stale"` and the current row, in the same envelope `already decided`
  already used.
  
  **Later and Skip** (migration `0019`, one nullable `snoozed_until`). *Later* is
  a snooze: the row stays pending, leaves Needs You and the morning brief, and
  comes back on its own (`METISTRY_SNOOZE_HOURS`, default 3) — it never ends a
  proposal. *Skip* declines with nothing to say and fires none of Decline's
  per-kind consequences: skipping an enrolment request does **not** revoke the
  agent, and its fixed `skipped` marker is excluded from every path that carries
  a decline's words anywhere. `POST /api/proposals/batch` applies `later`, `skip`
  or `deny` to many rows, all-or-nothing **per row** with a result for each; the
  queue gains multi-select and the keys `l` and `s`.
